    your problem is sprinkied throughout the site with css specificity making it very hard to acccess, go in and modiify each one

        border radius

    you element components must have the position absolute so it can  move with out breaking the window border or the containing app-root

testing
    
    https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCS/Platform+Configurator#/
    https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCS/Test+Configuration+Options
    unit testing- the single standalone feature works
    integration - when software comes on board they work fine
    regression - new code does not affect existing API

    i need to test on website functionality as well as the layout is working in selenium
        functionality
        layout
        feature detection
    
    with feature detection use inline css

    so to  listen to fn in lifecycle  hooks you must call the hooks again because in karma, with Testbed.createComponent, the compoent is redenred in a context
        Jasmine might not have access to so you must again call the fn like a unit test to see if it fired

    to access creden u put in a ssl file

    sauce labs expired so I cant test the eventListener but i think everything is fine

    there should be a data tyoe that can easily  change from a primitive to a sequence

    changing the wordsval
        error
            if theres one for something not consective in wordsVal, error, u have to take it outputting
            if we have more elements than specifc data

    make sure any argunment inside a function is placed in the class of a componennt service or directive

    to test events, you simply trigger them

    if you need data about function dont use spys they replace them instead simply invoke or interact with it it will give back synced desired values
        
    your try catch block is making your test fail can we look into another testing suite

angular

    our end goals are to be able to have the owner modify the site on their own
    I was told its impt to have unit testing so even though stuff should be in services
    
    we have one global ASP (application service provider) WordsSerivce, which is the endpoint for everything you app will need 

    first things first get at least 6 css style and focus on being responsive

    tip: you can use a Observable<Event> once using the rxjs fromEvent, and get several subscriptions
        use $ at the end to refer to them better 

    tip: refer to the navigation class in master 72 to use change detection ref to better deal with mutation events 

    tip: with the rxjs fromEvent, you can pass an array of elements to attach to 2 or more specifc elements

    so for syntax,
        wordsval0
        
        words - component name
        val - css global styling
        bool - wheter to display or not


        contents
            meaning
                val   - a value that can be expressed in DOM
                bool  - whether to have an item appear or not
                    should have made a bool and and style specfic to each component
                Seq   - whether to show several items
                group - see positioning object, when u
                GroupObject -  object to get data from the service back to the component instance
                suffix# - the id for specific item

            true meaning can be found in the service of the component

        positioning object
            since we refuse to have nested elements, we must associate a group of elements and give them an outside specifc
            fn that will properly calculate positioning and dimensions, for each instance of the component,
        
            the suffix used is group and when you use this it refers to each component instance not the specific word
            if there is no suffix  components will be added in a default positioning order,
            if there is a  suffix that means there is a a specific positioning order for that componennt instance
            so far our problem in ie is that on zoom down it kind ignores the left outputting but zoom up restores it
        
            we also need to access the DOM Element for better positioning, to access, everything and the component itself
      
            @ViewChildren('myval', { read: ElementRef })  appMyContainer: any;
            @ViewChildren('myval')  app_wordsMyElements: any;
            
            where myval isa template varible on app-words the component selector

        when elements are missing
            facts
                1. I cannot go back in wordsVal
                2. if an element, there is a least 1 copy with the id of any string past the index of this.wordsValInde[0]
                3. if there is a skip yr skipping at least

      window

        should I just do everything using top or have css values committed to each horiz vert combo

        background-position modifies the size of the image or the part of the image shown in the container

circleCI
    cant do this to get env vars
    curl [url] -H 'cache-control: no-cache'
    use a post request to defeat the cache problem


gits
    1.
        focusing on making sure the dashed lines can be properlly controlled and render uniformally through webpages
            so for later we plan to have the original style bootstrap from the serivce, although we should have this done through css
            I see that the values between services and components are not dynamically linked

  
js tips
                    ...Array.from(Array(1),(x,i)=> {
                        return {
                        override:'true',
                        css:{
                            position:'relative',
                            bottom:'234px',
                            left:'600px',
                            'fontSize':'16px'
                        }
                    }})

when creating array and you want to be neat   

use array.splice(-1)[0] to access its last value
also make sure you only incrementally add for the componentObject, location properties
avoid involving it in async
